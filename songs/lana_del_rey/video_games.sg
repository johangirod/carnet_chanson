\begin{verse}

\[F#m]Swinging in the \[A]backyard
\[F#m]Pull up in your \[A]fast car
\[C#m]Whistling my \[D]name
 
 
\[F#m]Open up a \[A]beer
And you \[F#m]take it over \[A]here
And play a \[C#m]video \[D]game  \[F#m]
 
 
I'm \[F#m]in his favorite \[A]sun dress
\[F#m]Watching me get \[A]undressed
\[C#m]Take that body \[D]downtown
\[F#m]I say you the \[A]bestest
\[F#m]Lean in for a \[A]big kiss
\[C#m]Put his favorite \[D]perfume \[F#m]on
Go play a \[C#m]video \[D]game
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
\[E]It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the \[D]time
Heaven is a place on earth with \[A]you
Tell me all the things you w\[A/G#]ant to \[F#m]do
I heard that you like the bad girls
\[D]Honey, is that true ?
It's better than I ever even \[A]knew
They say that the world was b\[A/G#]uilt for \[F#m]two
Only worth living if some\[D]body is loving \[D(dim)]you
Baby now you \[F#m]do
\end{chorus}

\[F#m]Singing in the \[A]old bars
\[F#m]Swinging with the \[A]old stars

\[F#m]Playing pool and \[A]wild darts
\[C#m]Video \[D]games  \[F#m]
 
 
\[F#m]He holds me in his \[A]big arms
\[F#m]Drunk and I am \[A]seeing stars
\[C#m]This is all I \[D]think of
 
 
\[F#m]Watching all our \[A]friends fall
